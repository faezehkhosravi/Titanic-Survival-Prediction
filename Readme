Explanation
Reading the dataset: I loaded the Titanic dataset from a CSV file.
Data preprocessing and feature engineering: I handleed missing values, convert categorical variables to numeric, and select relevant features for the model.
Data visualization: Using seaborn and matplotlib, we visualize the relationships between features and the correlation between them.
Implementing a machine learning algorithm: I split the data into training and testing sets, train a Logistic Regression model, and make predictions.
Evaluating the model's performance: I evaluated the model using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix to understand its performance.
